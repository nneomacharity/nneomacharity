### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
With a rich background in AI-driven marketing, I excel in blending data analytics and cutting-edge technology to enhance marketing approaches. My proficiency encompasses machine learning, generative AI, natural language procssing and neural networks, allowing me to leverage these tools for strategic insights.

My recent project involved analyzing historical marketing data from Twitter to dissect the nuances of Nike's 'Dream Crazy' campaign, employing Python's DASH framework for in-depth evaluation.

My experience extends to roles such as Digital Marketer, Social Media Manager and Content Creator, where I led content strategy across platforms, engaging diverse audiences and spearheading successful campaigns. At the University of Essex, my position as a Social Media Ambassador enabled me to partake in significant outreach endeavors.

I hold a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Essex, underpinned by a strong foundation in Mathematics and Education. I'm also an active supporter of diversity and inclusion, contributing to initiatives like Women in Data and Black Women in STEM.

Driven by a passion to redefine marketing through technology, I am eager to connect and collaborate on transformative marketing strategies. My conviction is that the essence of achieving business objectives lies in the relationship between businesses and their consumers. Over the last five years, I've honed skills in digital marketing, covering email marketing, social media management, business data analytics, content creation, SEO, PPC ads, influencer marketing, and affiliate marketing.

With advanced expertise in artificial intelligence, I am now focused on developing AI solutions tailored to address current challenges in digital marketing, employing machine learning, natural language processing, and generative AI, all rooted in marketing data insights.
