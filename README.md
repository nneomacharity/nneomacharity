### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I am a skilled AI-driven marketer with a proven track record of utilizing data and analytics to optimize marketing campaigns. My expertise lies in fusing artificial intelligence with marketing strategies to deliver exceptional results. With a strong proficiency in Python programming and a wide range of data analysis tools such as Pandas, Numpy, and Matplotlib, I possess the technical skills to extract valuable insights from large datasets.

In my recent project focused on AI in Marketing, I leveraged the Twitter social media platform to analyze past digital marketing campaigns and determine the success of future campaigns. This involved utilizing data visualization tools like Power Bi, Tableau, and Microsoft Excel to present marketing analytics effectively. Currently, I am extending this project by conducting an in-depth analysis of the 'Dream Crazy' campaign engineered by Nike on Twitter. I utilize data visualization tools to draw marketing facts, perform statistical analysis, and present the information through engaging data visualizations.

Throughout my career, I have held key roles such as Social Media Manager and Content Creator, overseeing the development and execution of content strategies on various social media platforms. I have successfully engaged with customers, created compelling marketing content, and implemented effective digital marketing campaigns. Additionally, my experience as a Social Media Ambassador at the University of Essex involved responding to inquiries, creating social media content, and collaborating with the digital marketing team on outreach programs.

I hold a Master's degree in Science in Artificial Intelligence and Its Applications from the University of Essex, where I have been recognized as an awardee of the Office for Student Scholarship. Complementing my academic achievements, I completed a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Education, which provides a solid foundation for data analysis and problem-solving.

Beyond my professional endeavors, I actively contribute to organizations such as Women in Data, Black Women in Stem, and Women in Computer Science and Electronic Engineering (WCSEE). These affiliations reflect my commitment to diversity, inclusion, and continuous learning within the field.

Driven by a passion for leveraging technology and data-driven insights, I am dedicated to transforming the marketing landscape. I invite you to connect with me so that we can explore opportunities for collaboration and together create innovative marketing strategies that yield outstanding results.
