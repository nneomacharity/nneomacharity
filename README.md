### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
As an accomplished marketer specializing in AI, I have a successful history of merging data-driven insights and technology to optimize marketing strategies. My expertise in Python and data analysis tools, such as Pandas and Numpy, empowers me to extract valuable insights from vast datasets.

I recently harnessed Twitter data to examine past marketing campaigns, using tools like Power Bi and Tableau to visualize data effectively. I am currently extending this project, performing a detailed analysis of Nike's 'Dream Crazy' campaign.

Having served as a Social Media Manager and Content Creator, I oversaw content strategies on various platforms, engaging audiences and crafting successful campaigns. My role as a Social Media Ambassador at the University of Essex allowed me to collaborate on impactful outreach programs.

I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Essex and a solid background in Mathematics and Education. Beyond work, I support diversity and inclusion initiatives, contributing to groups like Women in Data and Black Women in Stem.

I am passionate about harnessing technology to revolutionize marketing. I invite you to connect with me to explore collaborative opportunities and shape innovative marketing strategies together.
